## What is NoSQL?

* NoSQL means Not only SQL it refers to a non-relational database management system that provides a flexible way to store, access, and manage large amount of unstructured.


## Brief History of NoSQL Databases

* The first databases were non-relational and designed for specific use cases like hierarchical or network-based structures
* These early systems were not very flexible but worked for small, simple datasets.

## Why should we use NoSQL?
* it has wide range of usecases like scalability,flexibility,high performance,big data processing

* its different from SQL (Structured Query Language) databases that use tables, rows, and columns, NoSQL databases are designed to handle scalability, flexibility, and diverse data formats efficiently.

* NoSQL supports key-value pairs,documents,graphs,wide-columns

## Advantages of NoSQL

* Handles large-scale data effictively and maintaince scalability
* Easy to scale horizontally
* supports diverse data types and formates
* distributed architecture where data is often replicated across multiple servers to ensure high availabilty and fault tolerance

## Disadvantages of NoSQL

* weaker support of ACID transactions
* it has limited no. of querying capabilities compared with SQL

## Conclusion

* NOSQL comes to solve limitations of traditional relational databases in handling data workloads
conclusioon
* NoSQL databases are now essential for modern applications in industries like social media, e-commerce, IoT, and real-time analytics, providing faster, more reliable data storage solutions
